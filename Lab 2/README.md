Functionality (step 3) I have added: Altering the Military standard time to 
am/pm time with the push of a button. I also added the accurate year.
I added an am/pm versus hours label. Along with which standard time
we are in based on the moving slider. In lab2proof, the code is also in a txt file alongside the link above.

## Tutorial 1:
Please see Lab2 proof for Slider tutorial and tutorial 1 changes. 
The tutorial is a slider that changes the value of the letters when the
slider is moved. The tutoria also shows off a clock that changes time in
accordance to military hours in pacific standard time. The offset
allows you to choose different time zons t#han pactic stanard

## Tutorial 2:
API is an application program interface. We will be using financial stats extracted from the API ticker symbol and an "apikey=". I personally tried the AADI company ticker symbol after the AAPL was initially given. The JSON is an array of object that shows up in the documented webpage.
